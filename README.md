# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
This is a tool that visualizes pathfinding algorithms! 

# Features
- includes 3 algorithms: DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's
- includes maze algorithms (Currently working on them)
- can clear path and board with the click of a button

It is built in the react framework, use the pathfinding algorithm visualizer [here!](https://mckaymower.github.io/pav)
